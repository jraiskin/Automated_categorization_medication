- **1/3:** 
Fixed a lot of small latex and bibtex related bugs. 
To re-compile bibtex, use "comp-pdf-bib-tex Yarden_master_thesis" (compiles pdf, then bibtex *correctly*, then pdf x 2).
Started on NN preliminaries (in Related work chapter). Wrote on perceptron.
SVG file format - print to PDF.  
Todo:  
    - Work on github md file, add a check-box to quoted sources.  
    - Continue on activation functions, add different kinds of activations + figures.

    - Add background (motivation) on recent surge of NN success in vision, etc.  
    - Add background (motivation) BRIEF on NN as function approximators.  
    - Write on multi-layer perceptron, fully connected neural network.  
    - Gradient-based learning methods, backprop.   
    - **Next step**: RNN (wait with CNN), LSTM  
- **2/3:** 
Try and secure a work-station in CAB E81.  
Focus on state-of-the-art, no so much on a review of methods.  
Set up connection to math deprtment cluster, have TF1.0! (see _commands_).  
Finished writing about feed-forward NN, backprop (shallow).  
[Convert ris to bib file] (https://www.bruot.org/ris2bib/)  
Todo:  
    - Write on RNN.  
    (http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)  
    - Look for state-of-the-art in the field (or in analogous, if doesn't apply).  
- **3/3:** 
Wrote on RNN and LSTM, equations figures and all.  
Fixed minor issues in latex equations (reference and aligning).  
Todo:  
    - Hierarchical classification.  
    - Look for state-of-the-art in the field (or in analogous, if doesn't apply).
