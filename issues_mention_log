Explain:
    Deep learning
        Learn mappings (NN) and intermediate representations (layers depth)
        Theorems from deep learning, approximating functions
    
    Data strucrute
        ATC codes, hierarchical structure
        Targets can be non-unique, hand anotated and mapped to a unique set defined by those annotations
