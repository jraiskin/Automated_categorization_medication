# Explain:
    Deep learning
        Learn mappings (NN) and intermediate representations (layers depth)
        Theorems from deep learning, approximating functions
    
    Data strucrute
        ATC codes, hierarchical structure
        Targets can be non-unique, hand anotated and mapped to a unique set defined by those annotations
    

# Baseline
Train a linear classifier, SVM / log-reg on the input data (character-wise vector with fixed length?)

# Literature review - general topics

text sequence -> class (hierarchical structure?)

RNN classification
Bidirectional RNN classification
